This website is about creating a collaboration platform with the best tools for Product 
Development Research (PDR), it is also for building linkages and relationships between experts in academia and industry 
as well as research students to jointly explore
how the PDR tools will be used for advanced manpower skills development. This effort address the challenges of 
a certain class of Local Manufacturing Enterprises (LMEs) that are characterised by limited capacity to continuously
adapt their production processes to respond to changing market demand tastes and needs. Through developing local skills, 
manpower and capabilities, it is proposed that: </p>
<ol class="c">
<li> this class of manufacturers can have access to cost effective great products from the PDR </li> 
<li>  the highly skilled manpower envisaged is aimed to develop, support and foster a new 
indigenous culture of manufacturing business services. </li>
<li> The manufacturing business services will create demand for outsourcing manufacturing services. </li>
<li> Outsourcing manufacturing services cut venture capital costs and makes
it easy for Independent Product Developer (IPD)s to outsource manufacturing services and ?ourish, driving up the 
demand for outsourcing manufacturing services. </li>
<li> Increased manufacturing services demand will make it more 
profitable for specialised advancedmanufacturingservice providersto produce and meet their costs. </li>
<li> If thet are profitable, they can also further increase the variety of manufacturing services in the LME sector. </li>
</ol>
<p> Of course another class of manufacturers can be fully Vertical Integrated Value Chains (VIVC)s and have suf?cient 
internal resources  to develop technical solutions and services that enable such ?rm to respond to the market with 
new products and  services. And such manufacturing entities must have large capital investments, as well the manpower
 to provide the  technical services required. However, because of the large capital requirement to establish such 
 manufacturing ?rms, some manufacturers limit the number of services their ?rms can handle internally and therefore 
 also face the limited flexibility that characterises our targeted manufacturers. </p>
  <p>It is also understood that the LME sector is not fully developed 
  and therefore lacks many of the industrial links and services that characterise the more developed foreign manufacturing 
  locales. The gaps in the range of products and services manufactured present many local opportunities. Collaborating in 
  manufacturing to fill these gaps requires advanced technical skills, and presents new business and employment 
  opportunities as well as substituting for imports. Solving the technical manufacturing challenges that impede the 
  ?ourishing of LME innovations is not a simple undertaking, and it requires the developers to be convincing about 
  their capabilities as well as show their proposed solutions, and therefore part of the 
  objectives of this site is to propose, disseminate and demonstrate the solutions to the problems set out to be solved.
