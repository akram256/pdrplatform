		<h5><b>The PDR Platform</b></h5>
		<p>This is an interaction platform for product and process development professionals and engineers 
		who want to know where to find facilities, processes, equipment and tools, and the technical personnel 
		to support them, to create and manufacture high quality competitive goods and services for the 
		large local market.
		</p>
		<p>Many professionals and companies have access to some manufacturing processes and equipment, however,
		advances in technology mean that companies have to specialise and limit the scope of tools and processes they 
		can economically utilise. A lot of manufacturing capacity is therefore available to be explored. This platform brings 
		together these professionals and provides a forum to know what they can do for each other in line with new product 
		and process development goals.
