<p>PDR forms the foundations of creating great products. In regard to this effort, the key of PDR is to answer questions, like,
at what level of applied research does the PDR convert the applied science into the developing products? 
The understanding of applied research is limited to manufacturing PDR. And also only the PDR component 
applicable to developing successful products for the LME sector will be addressed. PDR in this essence is therefore the application 
of applied research solutions and how they can be engineered into products. This PDR process pays attention to the available 
applicable technologies and how these technologies can be adapted into manufacturing sites and links for high quality, cost effective and competitive 
production processes. In the local context, the key is therefore knowing the available spectrum of used technologies 
and:
<ol> 
<li> link the sector players into Vertical Integrated Value Chains </li>
<li> provide PDR services and technical support needed to achieve high quality, cost effective and competitive products
 and manufacturing services</li>
 <li> Support, encourage, promote and provide suf?cient market product differentiation </li>
 <li> continuously support innovations to deter market product saturation and sustain high market PDR product interest.
 </li>
 </ol>  
 <p>And there are many challenges to address. So the PDR platform is seeking partners who can support our efforts of:</p>
<h4>Improve the Low PDR record</h4>
<p>The country has very few proven applied PDR solutions, and therefore lacks the technical foundations to be competitive
 as far as new PDR from applied research is concerned, and therefore, there is need to create some great examples</p>
 
 <h4>Strategic PDR funding</h4>
 <p>It takes a long period of time for applied research before it can be ready for PDR and commercialisation, this stage of
  R&amp;D is the preserve of national institutions, including research institutes and universities as an international norm. Therefore 
  partnerships that link to those institutions be strengthened.  The industries that need PDR solutions have a lot of economic 
  benefits if they can support research students doing PDR in public institutions.</p>
