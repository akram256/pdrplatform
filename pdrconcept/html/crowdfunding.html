				<div class="col-sm-4">
				<p> Below are some of the many reasons why you may like to consider crowd funding our ideas, because together we can build 
				a prosperous hassle free investment. </p>
				 <p><b>One is opportunity</b>, today, technology makes it easy to document collections of small amounts 
				 of money, transparently, from hundreds of 	thousands of individuals. </p>
				<p><b>The second reason is connectivity</b>, with the growth of the local Internet users on 
				platforms, communicating about their social and economic concerns. </p>
				<p><b>The third is electronic money transmission</b> the availability of 
				electronic money transmission, we believe provides another enabler so we can join hands together and solve common 
				social economic challenges together. </p> 
				</div><div class="col-sm-4">
				<p><b>The fourth is technical capacity</b>, many investments have been made to promote and increase the productivity 
				of the local small to medium scale enterprises, the PDR platform presents a technical platform to bring like 
				minded technical experts with a passion to develop and make products that solve know social-economic challenges 
				in our industrial market. These experts are common members of our society and believe in making a difference. </p>
				<p><b>The fifth is small SMEs</b>, the scope of work these entities can afford to invest and focus on is limited 
				and does not create the scale of business and employment opportunities to take up many of the  youth. So we can share
				our rich experiences and help the youth forge a more prosperous and unlimited investment rich future.</p> 
				</div><div class="col-sm-4">
				<p><b> The sixth is low risk</b>, built on the reasons given, crowd funding is an alternative solution to the expensive
				and high risk investments, because it requires small amounts of disposable income but aggregates a large number of people,</p>
				<p>Those reasons are why crowd funding has been a very successful model for funding startups all over the world. 
				And we believe we can professionally use the same model to create amazing businesses as well as companies that can 
				fulfill common investment objectives.</p>
				<p> You will see the startup capital cost against your contribution until the target capital is attained, and then 
				start showing you the interest accrued on your disposable income. Welcome and join our crowd funding initiative.
